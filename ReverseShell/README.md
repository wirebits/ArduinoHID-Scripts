# Reverse Shell
It gives the complete control of the victim computer.

# Use
- Replace `folder_name` with the folder name you want.
- Replace `nctool_url` with the URL of the netcat tool.
- Replace `output_file` with name of the file you want to save with that name.
- Replace `0.0.0.0` with the attacker IP.
- Compile and upload the code on any supported board you have using Arduino IDE.
- Done!

# NetCat Tool URL
- This is for windows only.
- Just copy and paste by replacing `nctool_url`.
